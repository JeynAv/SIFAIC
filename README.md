# SIFAIC
Revolutionizing image classification, CNNs lack interpretability. To address this, we explore explainability using ResNet-34 and LIME for aerial images. Our model, SIFAIC, which was developed in PyTorch bridges complexity and transparency.

Note: Since Github only allows uploading of files up to 25 mb, we were not able to upload the model file. You may, however, run the main notebook to train and save the model for inferencing.
